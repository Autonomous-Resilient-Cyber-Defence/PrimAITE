``system services``
"""""""""""""""""""

Some services are pre installed on nodes - this is similar to how some services are included with the Operating System.

The service may not be configured as needed, in which case, see the relevant service page.

The list of services that are considered system software are:

- ``DNSClient``
- ``FTPClient``
- ``NTPClient``
