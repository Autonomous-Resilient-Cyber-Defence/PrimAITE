FTP Client Server
=================

FTP Server
----------
Provides a FTP Client-Server simulation by extending the base Service class.

Key capabilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Simulates FTP requests and FTPPacket transfer across a network
- Allows the emulation of FTP commands between an FTP client and server:
    - STOR: stores a file from client to server
    - RETR: retrieves a file from the FTP server
- Leverages the Service base class for install/uninstall, status tracking, etc.

Usage
^^^^^
- Install on a Node via the ``SoftwareManager`` to start the FTP server service.
- Service runs on FTP (command) port 21 by default. (TODO: look at in depth implementation of FTP PORT command)

Implementation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- FTP request and responses use a ``FTPPacket`` object
- Extends Service class for integration with ``SoftwareManager``.

FTP Client
----------

The ``FTPClient`` provides a client interface for connecting to the ``FTPServer``.

Key features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Connects to the ``FTPServer`` via the ``SoftwareManager``.
- Simulates FTP requests and FTPPacket transfer across a network
- Allows the emulation of FTP commands between an FTP client and server:
    - PORT: specifies the port that server should connect to on the client (currently only uses ``Port.FTP``)
    - STOR: stores a file from client to server
    - RETR: retrieves a file from the FTP server
    - QUIT: disconnect from server
- Leverages the Service base class for install/uninstall, status tracking, etc.

Usage
^^^^^

- Install on a Node via the ``SoftwareManager`` to start the FTP client service.
- Service runs on FTP (command) port 21 by default. (TODO: look at in depth implementation of FTP PORT command)
- Execute sending a file to the FTP server with ``send_file``
- Execute retrieving a file from the FTP server with ``request_file``

Implementation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Leverages ``SoftwareManager`` for sending payloads over the network.
- Provides easy interface for Nodes to transfer files between each other.
- Extends base Service class.
