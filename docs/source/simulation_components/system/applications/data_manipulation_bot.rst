.. _DataManipulationBot:

DataManipulationBot
###################

The ``DataManipulationBot`` class provides functionality to connect to a :ref:`DatabaseService` and execute malicious SQL statements.

Overview
========

The bot is intended to simulate a malicious actor carrying out attacks like:

- Dropping tables
- Deleting records
- Modifying data

on a database server by abusing an application's trusted database connectivity.

The bot performs attacks in the following stages to simulate the real pattern of an attack:

- Logon - *The bot gains credentials and accesses the node.*
- Port Scan - *The bot finds accessible database servers on the network.*
- Attacking - *The bot delivers the payload to the discovered database servers.*

Each of these stages has a random, configurable probability of succeeding (by default 10%). The bot can also be configured to repeat the attack once complete.

Usage
=====

- Create an instance and call ``configure`` to set:
    - Target database server IP
    - Database password (if needed)
    - SQL statement payload
    - Probabilities for succeeding each of the above attack stages
- Call ``run`` to connect and execute the statement.

The bot handles connecting, executing the statement, and disconnecting.

In a simulation, the bot can be controlled by using ``DataManipulationAgent`` which calls ``run`` on the bot at configured timesteps.

Implementation
==============

The bot extends :ref:`DatabaseClient` and leverages its connectivity.

- Uses the Application base class for lifecycle management.
- Credentials, target IP and other options set via ``configure``.
- ``run`` handles connecting, executing statement, and disconnecting.
- SQL payload executed via ``query`` method.
- Results in malicious SQL being executed on remote database server.


Examples
========

Python
""""""

.. code-block:: python

    from primaite.simulator.network.hardware.nodes.host.computer import Computer
    from primaite.simulator.network.hardware.node_operating_state import NodeOperatingState
    from primaite.simulator.system.applications.red_applications.data_manipulation_bot import DataManipulationBot

    client_1 = Computer(
        hostname="client_1",
        ip_address="192.168.10.21",
        subnet_mask="255.255.255.0",
        default_gateway="192.168.10.1",
        operating_state=NodeOperatingState.ON # initialise the computer in an ON state
    )
    network.connect(endpoint_b=client_1.network_interface[1], endpoint_a=switch_2.network_interface[1])
    client_1.software_manager.install(DataManipulationBot)
    data_manipulation_bot: DataManipulationBot = client_1.software_manager.software.get("DataManipulationBot")
    data_manipulation_bot.configure(server_ip_address=IPv4Address("192.168.1.14"), payload="DELETE")
    data_manipulation_bot.run()

This would connect to the database service at 192.168.1.14, authenticate, and execute the SQL statement to drop the 'users' table.

Example with ``DataManipulationAgent``
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If not using the data manipulation bot manually, it needs to be used with a data manipulation agent. Below is an example section of configuration file for setting up a simulation with data manipulation bot and agent.
