DatabaseService
###############

The ``DatabaseService`` provides a SQL database server simulation by extending the base Service class.

Key capabilities
================

- Creates a database file in the ``FileSystem`` of the ``Node`` (which the ``DatabaseService`` is installed on) upon creation.
- Handles connecting clients by maintaining a dictionary of connections mapped to session IDs.
- Authenticates connections using a configurable password.
- Simulates ``SELECT``, ``DELETE`` and ``INSERT`` SQL queries.
- Returns query results and status codes back to clients.
- Leverages the Service base class for install/uninstall, status tracking, etc.

Usage
=====
- Install on a Node via the ``SoftwareManager`` to start the database service.
- Clients connect, execute queries, and disconnect.
- Service runs on TCP port 5432 by default.

**Supported queries:**

* ``SELECT``: As long as the database file is in a ``GOOD`` health state, the db service will respond with a 200 status code.
* ``DELETE``: This query represents an attack, it will cause the database file to enter a ``COMPROMISED`` state, and return a status code 200.
* ``INSERT``: If the database service is in a healthy state, this will return a 200 status, if it's not in a healthy state it will return 404.
* ``SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity``: This query represents something an admin would send to check the status of the database. If the database service is in a healthy state, it returns a 200 status code, otherwise a 401 status code.

Implementation
==============

- Creates the database file within the node's file system.
- Manages client connections in a dictionary by session ID.
- Processes SQL queries.
- Returns results and status codes in a standard dictionary format.
- Extends Service class for integration with ``SoftwareManager``.

Configuration
=============

``backup_server_ip``
""""""""""""""""""""

Optional. Default value is ``None``.

The IP Address of the backup server that the ``DatabaseService`` will use to create backups of the database.

This must be a valid octet i.e. in the range of ``0.0.0.0`` and ``255.255.255.255``.

``password``
""""""""""""

Optional. Default value is ``None``.

The password that needs to be provided by connecting clients in order to create a successful connection.
