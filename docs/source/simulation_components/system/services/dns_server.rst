.. _DNSServer:

DNSServer
#########

Also known as a DNS Resolver, the ``DNSServer`` provides a DNS Server simulation by extending the base Service class.

Key capabilities
================

- Simulates DNS requests and DNSPacket transfer across a network
- Registers domain names and the IP Address linked to the domain name
- Returns the IP address for a given domain name within a DNS Packet that a DNS Client can read
- Leverages the Service base class for install/uninstall, status tracking, etc.

Usage
=====
- Install on a Node via the ``SoftwareManager`` to start the database service.
- Service runs on TCP port 53 by default. (TODO: TCP for now, should be UDP in future)

Implementation
==============

- DNS request and responses use a ``DNSPacket`` object
- Extends Service class for integration with ``SoftwareManager``.

Examples
========

Configuration
=============


``domain_mapping``
""""""""""""""""""

Domain mapping takes the domain and IP Addresses as a key-value pairs i.e.

If the domain is "arcd.com" and the IP Address attributed to the domain is 192.168.0.10, then the value should be ``arcd.com: 192.168.0.10``

The key must be a string and the IP Address must be a valid octet i.e. in the range of ``0.0.0.0`` and ``255.255.255.255``.
