.. _FTPClient:

FTPClient
#########

The ``FTPClient`` provides a client interface for connecting to the :ref:`FTPServer`.

Key features
============

- Connects to the :ref:`FTPServer` via the ``SoftwareManager``.
- Simulates FTP requests and FTPPacket transfer across a network
- Allows the emulation of FTP commands between an FTP client and server:
    - PORT: specifies the port that server should connect to on the client (currently only uses ``Port.FTP``)
    - STOR: stores a file from client to server
    - RETR: retrieves a file from the FTP server
    - QUIT: disconnect from server
- Leverages the Service base class for install/uninstall, status tracking, etc.
- :ref:`FTPClient` and ``FTPServer`` utilise port 21 (FTP) throughout all file transfer / request

Usage
=====

- Install on a Node via the ``SoftwareManager`` to start the FTP client service.
- Service runs on FTP (command) port 21 by default
- Execute sending a file to the FTP server with ``send_file``
- Execute retrieving a file from the FTP server with ``request_file``

Implementation
==============

- Leverages ``SoftwareManager`` for sending payloads over the network.
- Provides easy interface for Nodes to transfer files between each other.
- Extends base Service class.
