Rewards
#######

Rewards in PrimAITE are based on a system of individual components that react to events in the simulation. An agent's reward function is calculated as the weighted sum of several reward components.

Some rewards, such as the ``GreenAdminDatabaseUnreachablePenalty``, can be marked as 'sticky' in their configuration. Setting this to ``True`` will mean that they continue to output the same value after an event until another event of that type.
In the instance of the ``GreenAdminDatabaseUnreachablePenalty``, the database admin reward will stay negative until the next successful database request is made, even if the database admin agents do nothing and the database returns a good state.

Components
**********
The following API pages describe the use of each reward component and the possible configuration options. An example of configuring each via yaml is also provided.
