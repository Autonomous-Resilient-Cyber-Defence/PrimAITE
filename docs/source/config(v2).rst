The Config Files Explained
==========================

Note: This file describes the config files used in legacy PrimAITE v2.0. This file will be removed soon.

PrimAITE uses two configuration files for its operation:

* **The Training Config**

    Used to define the top-level settings of the PrimAITE environment, the reward values, and the session that is to be run.

* **The Lay Down Config**

    Used to define the low-level settings of a session, including the network laydown, green / red agent information exchange requirements (IERSs) and Access Control Rules.

Training Config:
*******************

The Training Config file consists of the following attributes:

**Generic Config Values**


* **agent_framework** [enum]

    This identifies the agent framework to be used to instantiate the agent algorithm. Select from one of the following:

    * NONE - Where a user developed agent is to be used
    * SB3 - Stable Baselines3
    * RLLIB - Ray RLlib.

* **agent_identifier**

    This identifies the agent to use for the session. Select from one of the following:

    * A2C - Advantage Actor Critic
    * PPO - Proximal Policy Optimization
    * HARDCODED - A custom built deterministic agent
    * RANDOM - A Stochastic random agent


* **random_red_agent** [bool]

    Determines if the session should be run with a random red agent

* **action_type** [enum]

    Determines whether a NODE, ACL, or ANY (combined NODE & ACL) action space format is adopted for the session


* **OBSERVATION_SPACE** [dict]

    Allows for user to configure observation space by combining one or more observation components. List of available
    components is in :py:mod:`primaite.environment.observations`.

    The observation space config item should have a ``components`` key which is a list of components. Each component
    config must have a ``name`` key, and can optionally have an ``options`` key. The ``options`` are passed to the
    component while it is being initialised.

    This example illustrates the correct format for the observation space config item

    .. code-block:: yaml

        observation_space:
        components:
          - name: NODE_LINK_TABLE
          - name: NODE_STATUSES
          - name: LINK_TRAFFIC_LEVELS
          - name: ACCESS_CONTROL_LIST
            options:
              combine_service_traffic : False
              quantisation_levels: 99


    Currently available components are:

      * :py:mod:`NODE_LINK_TABLE<primaite.environment.observations.NodeLinkTable>` this does not accept any additional options
      * :py:mod:`NODE_STATUSES<primaite.environment.observations.NodeStatuses>`, this does not accept any additional options
      * :py:mod:`ACCESS_CONTROL_LIST<primaite.environment.observations.AccessControlList>`, this does not accept additional options
      * :py:mod:`LINK_TRAFFIC_LEVELS<primaite.environment.observations.LinkTrafficLevels>`, this accepts the following options:

        * ``combine_service_traffic`` - whether to consider bandwidth use separately for each network protocol or combine them into a single bandwidth reading (boolean)
        * ``quantisation_levels`` - how many discrete bandwidth usage levels to use for encoding. This can be an integer equal to or greater than 3.

    The other configurable item is ``flatten`` which is false by default. When set to true, the observation space is flattened (turned into a 1-D vector). You should use this if your RL agent does not natively support observation space types like ``gym.Spaces.Tuple``.

* **num_train_episodes** [int]

    This defines the number of episodes that the agent will train for.


* **num_train_steps** [int]

    Determines the number of steps to run in each episode of the training session.


* **num_eval_episodes** [int]

    This defines the number of episodes that the agent will be evaluated over.


* **num_eval_steps** [int]

    Determines the number of steps to run in each episode of the evaluation session.


* **time_delay** [int]

    The time delay (in milliseconds) to take between each step when running a GENERIC agent session


* **session_type** [text]

    Type of session to be run (TRAINING, EVALUATION, or BOTH)

* **load_agent** [bool]

    Determine whether to load an agent from file

* **agent_load_file** [text]

    File path and file name of agent if you're loading one in

* **observation_space_high_value** [int]

    The high value to use for values in the observation space. This is set to 1000000000 by default, and should not need changing in most cases

* **implicit_acl_rule** [str]

    Determines which Explicit rule the ACL list has - two options are: DENY or ALLOW.

* **max_number_acl_rules** [int]

    Sets a limit on how many ACL rules there can be in the ACL list throughout the training session.
