Creating Custom Environments for PrimAITE
*****************************************

PrimAITE generates it's training configuration/Environments through ingestion of YAML files. A detailed walkthrough of how to create your own environment can be found within the ``Creating-Custom-Environments`` jupyter notebook.

You configuration file should follow the hierarchy seen below:

.. code:: yaml

    metadata:
        version: 4.0

    required_plugins:
        - name: Example_Plugin
          version: 1.0

    io_settings:
    ...
    game:
    ...
    agents:
    ...
    simulation:
    ...

MetaData
========

It's important to include the metadata tag within your YAML file, as this is used to ensure PrimAITE can interpret the configuration correctly. This should also include any plugins that are required for the defined environment, along with their respective version.

Required Plugins
================

Should your custom environment need any additional PrimAITE plugins, each must be specified under the `required_plugins` tab, as seen in the above example.

Configuration Items
===================

For detailed information about the remaining configuration items found within the configuration file, see :ref:`Configurable Items`.
