PrimAITE |VERSION| Configuration
********************************

PrimAITE uses YAML configuration files to define everything needed to create the training environment for RL agents, including the network, the scripted agents, and the RL agent's action space, observation space, and reward function.

Example Configuration Hierarchy
###############################
The top level configuration items in a configuration file is as follows

.. code-block:: yaml

    io_settings:
    ...
    game:
    ...
    agents:
    ...
    simulation:
    ...

These are expanded upon in the Configurable items section below

Configurable items
##################

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   configuration/io_settings.rst
   configuration/game.rst
   configuration/agents.rst
   configuration/simulation.rst

Varying The Configuration Each Episode
######################################

PrimAITE allows for the configuration to be varied each episode. This is done by specifying a configuration folder instead of a single file. A full explanation is provided in the notebook `Using-Episode-Schedules.ipynb`. Please find the notebook in the user notebooks directory.
