``simulation``
==============
In this section the network layout is defined. This part of the config follows a hierarchical structure. Almost every component defines a ``ref`` field which acts as a human-readable unique identifier, used by other parts of the config, such as agents.

At the top level of the network are ``nodes`` and ``links``.

e.g.

.. code-block:: yaml

    simulation:
        network:
            nodes:
            ...
            links:
            ...

``nodes``
---------

This is where the list of nodes are defined. Some items will differ according to the node type, however, there will be common items such as a node's reference (which is used by the agent), the node's ``type`` and ``hostname``

To see the configuration for these nodes, refer to the following:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    simulation/nodes/computer.rst
    simulation/nodes/firewall.rst
    simulation/nodes/router.rst
    simulation/nodes/server.rst
    simulation/nodes/switch.rst

``links``
---------

This is where the links between the nodes are formed.

e.g.

In order to recreate the network below, we will need to create 2 links:

- a link from computer_1 to the switch
- a link from computer_2 to the switch

.. image:: ../../_static/switched_p2p_network.png
    :width: 500
    :align: center

this results in:

.. code-block:: yaml

    links:
        - ref: computer_1___switch
        endpoint_a_ref: computer_1
        endpoint_a_port: 1 # port 1 on computer_1
        endpoint_b_ref: switch
        endpoint_b_port: 1 # port 1 on switch
        - ref: computer_2___switch
        endpoint_a_ref: computer_2
        endpoint_a_port: 1 # port 1 on computer_2
        endpoint_b_ref: switch
        endpoint_b_port: 2 # port 2 on switch

``ref``
^^^^^^^

The human readable name for the link. Not used in code, however is useful for a human to understand what the link is for.

``endpoint_a_ref``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The name of the node which must be connected.

``endpoint_a_port``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The port on ``endpoint_a_ref`` which is to be connected to ``endpoint_b_port``.
This accepts an integer value e.g. if port 1 is to be connected, the configuration should be ``endpoint_a_port: 1``

``endpoint_b_ref``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The name of the node which must be connected.

``endpoint_b_port``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The port on ``endpoint_b_ref`` which is to be connected to ``endpoint_a_port``.
This accepts an integer value e.g. if port 1 is to be connected, the configuration should be ``endpoint_b_port: 1``
