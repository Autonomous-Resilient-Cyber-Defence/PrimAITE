How-To Guides
=============

These how-to guides aim to provide a starting point for development within PrimAITE, creating your own custom components and environments for use when training agents. More detailed information for each section can be found within the documentation.

There are also some additional notebooks which provide a walkthrough of established content. It's encouraged to reference these when developing for PrimAITE.
