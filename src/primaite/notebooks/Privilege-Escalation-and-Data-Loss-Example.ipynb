    "# Simulating Privilege Escalation and Data Loss Using SSH and ACLs Manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "© Crown-owned copyright 2025, Defence Science and Technology Laboratory UK\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook demonstrates a cyber scenario focusing on internal privilege escalation and data loss through the manipulation of SSH access and Access Control Lists (ACLs). The scenario is designed to model and visualise how a disgruntled junior engineer might exploit internal network vulnerabilities and social engineering of account credentials to escalate privileges and cause significant data loss and disruption to services.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This simulation utilises the PrimAITE demo network, focussing specifically on five nodes:\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"_package_data/primaite_demo_network.png\" target=\"_blank\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"_package_data/primaite_demo_network.png\" alt=\"Description of Image\" style=\"width:100%; max-width:450px;\">\n",
    "</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SomeTech Developer PC (`some_tech_jnr_dev_pc`)**: The workstation used by the junior engineer.\n",
    "- **SomeTech Core Router (`some_tech_rt`)**: A critical network device that controls access between nodes.\n",
    "- **SomeTech PostgreSQL Database Server (`some_tech_db_srv`)**: Hosts the company’s critical database.\n",
    "- **SomeTech Storage Server (`some_tech_storage_srv`)**: Stores important files and database backups.\n",
    "- **SomeTech Web Server (`some_tech_web_srv`)**: Serves the company’s website.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the junior developer PC is restricted from connecting to the storage server via FTP or SSH due to ACL rules that permit only senior members of the engineering team to access these services.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the scenario is to simulate how the junior engineer, after gaining unauthorised access to the core router, manipulates ACL rules to escalate privileges and delete critical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Actions Simulated\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Privilege Escalation**: The junior engineer uses social engineering to obtain login credentials for the core router, SSHs into the router, and modifies the ACL rules to allow SSH access from their PC to the storage server.\n",
    "2. **Remote Access**: The junior engineer then uses the newly gained SSH access to connect to the storage server from their PC. This step is crucial for executing further actions, such as deleting files.\n",
    "3. **File Deletion**: With SSH access to the storage server, the engineer deletes the backup file from the storage server and subsequently removes critical data from the PostgreSQL database, bringing down the sometech.ai website.\n",
    "4.  **Website Impact Verification:** After the deletion of the database backup, the scenario checks the sometech.ai website's status to confirm it has been brought down due to the data loss.\n",
    "5.  **Database Restore Failure:** An attempt is made to restore the deleted backup, demonstrating that the restoration fails and highlighting the severity of the data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes:\n",
    "- The demo will utilise CAOS (Common Action and Observation Space) actions wherever they are available. For actions where a CAOS action does not yet exist, the action will be performed manually on the node/service.\n",
    "- This notebook will be updated to incorporate new CAOS actions as they become supported."

    "\n",
    "In this simulation, we modelled a cyber attack scenario where a disgruntled junior engineer exploits internal network vulnerabilities to escalate privileges, causing significant data loss and disruption of services. The following key actions were performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Privilege Escalation:** The junior engineer used social engineering to obtain the login credentials for the core router. They remotely accessed the router via SSH and modified the ACL rules to grant SSH access from their machine to the storage server.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Remote Access:** With the modified ACLs in place, the engineer was able to SSH into the storage server from their machine. This access enabled them to interact with the storage server and perform further actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **File & Data Deletion:** The engineer used SSH remote access to delete a critical database backup file from the storage server. Subsequently, they executed a SQL command to delete critical data from the PostgreSQL database, which resulted in the disruption of the sometech.ai website.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Website Status Verification:** After the deletion of the database backup, the website's status was checked to confirm that it had been brought down due to the data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Database Restore Failure:** An attempt to restore the deleted backup was made to demonstrate that the restoration process failed, highlighting the severity of the data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Verification and Outcomes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Initial State Verification:** The backup file was confirmed to be present on the storage server before any actions were taken. The junior engineer's inability to SSH into the storage server initially confirmed that ACL restrictions were in effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Privilege Escalation Confirmation:** The successful modification of the ACL rules was verified by checking the router's ACL table.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Remote Access Verification:** After the ACL modification, the engineer successfully SSH'd into the storage server from their PC. The file system inspection confirmed that the backup file was accessible and could be deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **File Deletion Confirmation:** The deletion of the backup file was confirmed by inspecting the storage server's file system after the operation. The backup file was marked as deleted, validating that the deletion command was executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Database and Website Impact:** The deletion of the database backup was followed by a DELETE query executed on the PostgreSQL database. The website's functionality was subsequently checked using a web browser, confirming that the sometech.ai website was down due to the data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Restore Attempt Verification:** An attempt to restore the deleted database backup was made, and it was confirmed that the restoration failed, highlighting the impact of the data deletion."
