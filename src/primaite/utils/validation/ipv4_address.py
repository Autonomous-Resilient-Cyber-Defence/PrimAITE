This type is essentially an IPv4Address from the standard library's ipaddress module,

will automatically check and convert the input value to an instance of IPv4Address before
any Pydantic model uses it. This ensures that any field marked with this type is not just
an IPv4Address in form, but also valid according to the rules defined in ipv4_validator.
