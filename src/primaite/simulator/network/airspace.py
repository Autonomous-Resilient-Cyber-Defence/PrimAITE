    template for creating specific wireless network interfaces that support Internet Protocol (IP) functionalities.

    As this class is a combination of its parent classes without additional attributes or methods, please refer to
    the documentation of `WirelessNetworkInterface` and `Layer3Interface` for more details on the supported operations

    - `WirelessNetworkInterface`: Providing the functionalities and characteristics of a wireless connection, such as

    of IP routing and addressing, such as wireless routers, access points, and wireless end-host devices like
