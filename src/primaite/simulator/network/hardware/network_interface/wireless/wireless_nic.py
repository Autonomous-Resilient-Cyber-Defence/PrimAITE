class WirelessNIC(IPWirelessNetworkInterface):
    """
    Represents a Wireless Network Interface Card (Wireless NIC) in a network device.

    This class encapsulates the functionalities and attributes of a wireless NIC, combining the characteristics of a
    wireless network interface with Layer 3 features. It is capable of connecting to wireless networks, managing
    wireless-specific properties such as signal strength and security protocols, and also handling IP-related
    functionalities like IP addressing and subnetting.

    Inherits from:
    - WirelessNetworkInterface: Provides basic properties and methods specific to wireless interfaces.
    - Layer3Interface: Provides Layer 3 properties like ip_address and subnet_mask, enabling the device to participate
      in IP-based networking.

    This class can be extended to include more advanced features or to tailor its behavior for specific types of
    wireless networks or protocols.
