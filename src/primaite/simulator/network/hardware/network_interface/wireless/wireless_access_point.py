class WirelessAccessPoint(IPWirelessNetworkInterface):
    """
    Represents a Wireless Access Point (AP) in a network.

    This class models a Wireless Access Point, a device that allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network
    using Wi-Fi or other wireless standards. The Wireless Access Point bridges the wireless and wired segments of
    the network, allowing wireless devices to communicate with other devices on the network.

    As an integral component of wireless networking, a Wireless Access Point provides functionalities for network
    management, signal broadcasting, security enforcement, and connection handling. It also possesses Layer 3
    capabilities such as IP addressing and subnetting, allowing for network segmentation and routing.

    Inherits from:
    - WirelessNetworkInterface: Provides basic properties and methods specific to wireless interfaces.
    - Layer3Interface: Provides Layer 3 properties like ip_address and subnet_mask, enabling the device to manage
      network traffic and routing.

    This class can be further specialised or extended to support specific features or standards related to wireless
    networking, such as different Wi-Fi versions, frequency bands, or advanced security protocols.
