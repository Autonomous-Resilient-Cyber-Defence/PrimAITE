        Calculate a good acl-based action for the blue agent to take.

        Knowledge of just the observation space is insufficient for a perfect solution, as we need to know:

            - Which ACL rules already exist, - otherwise:
                 - The agent would perminently get stuck in a loop of performing the same action over and over.
                 (best action is to block something, but its already blocked but doesn't know this)
                 - The agent would be unable to interact with existing rules (e.g. how would it know to delete a rule,
                 if it doesnt know what rules exist)
            - The Green IERs (optional) - It often needs to know which traffic it should be allowing. For example
             in the default config one of the green IERs is blocked by default, but it has no way of knowing this
             based on the observation space. Additionally, potentially in the future, once a node state
             has been fixed (no longer compromised), it needs a way to know it should reallow traffic.
             A RL agent can learn what the green IERs are on its own - but the rule based agent cannot easily do this.

        There doesn't seem like there's much that can be done if an Operating or OS State is compromised

        If a service node becomes compromised there's a decision to make - do we block that service?
        Pros: It cannot launch an attack on another node, so the node will not be able to be OVERWHELMED
        Cons: Will block a green IER, decreasing the reward
        We decide to block the service.

        Potentially a better solution (for the reward) would be to block the incomming traffic from compromised
        nodes once a service becomes overwhelmed. However currently the ACL action space has no way of reversing
        an overwhelmed state, so we don't do this.

        We rely on randomness to select the precise action, as we want to
        block all traffic originating from a compromised node, without being
        able to tell:
