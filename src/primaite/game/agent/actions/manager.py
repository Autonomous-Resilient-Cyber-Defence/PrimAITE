        The action space config supports the following three sections:
            1. ``action_list``
                ``action_list`` contains a list action components which need to be included in the action space.
                Each action component has a ``type`` which maps to a subclass of AbstractAction, and additional options
                which will be passed to the action class's __init__ method during initialisation.
            2. ``action_map``
                Since the agent uses a discrete action space which acts as a flattened version of the component-based
                action space, action_map provides a mapping between an integer (chosen by the agent) and a meaningful
                action and values of parameters. For example action 0 can correspond to do nothing, action 1 can
                correspond to "NODE_SERVICE_SCAN" with ``node_id=1`` and ``service_id=1``, action 2 can be "
            3. ``options``
                ``options`` contains a dictionary of options which are passed to the ActionManager's __init__ method.
                These options are used to calculate the shape of the action space, and to provide additional information
