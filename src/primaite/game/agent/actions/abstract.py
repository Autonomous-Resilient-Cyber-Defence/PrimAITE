# notes:
# we actually don't need to hold any state in actions, so there's no need to define any __init__ logic.
# all the init methods in the old actions are just used for holding a verb and shape, which are not really used.
# the config schema should be used to the actual parameters for formatting the action itself.
# (therefore there's no need for creating action instances, just the action class contains logic for converting
# CAOS actions to requests for simulator. Similar to the network node adder, that class also doesn't need to be
# instantiated.)
