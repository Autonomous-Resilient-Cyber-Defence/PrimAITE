    TAP Actions are returned to the Request Manager as a Tuple

    1. Kill Chain Progression

    Kill Chains are IntEnums which define the different stages within a kill chain.
    These stages are intended to be used across multiple ARCD environments.

    2. Abstract Methods For Kill Chain Control Flow

    Abstract methods _progress_kill_chain & _setup_kill_chain
    are intended to provide TAP type agent additional control
    over execution flow in comparison to AbstractScriptedAgent.

    Usually these methods handle kill chain progression & success criteria.

    For more information about Abstract TAPs please refer
    to the methods & attributes documentation directly.

    Additionally, Refer to a specific TAP for a more specific example.
