# How to contribute to PrimAITE?


### **Did you find a bug?**


* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Autonomous-Resilient-Cyber-Defence/PrimAITE/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Autonomous-Resilient-Cyber-Defence/PrimAITE/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+-+%3Cbug+title+goes+here%3E). Be sure to follow our bug report template with the headers **Describe the bug**, **To Reproduce**, **Expected behaviour**, **Screenshots/Outputs**, **Environment**, and **Additional context**


### **Do you have a solution to fix the bug?**

* [Fork the repository](https://github.com/Autonomous-Resilient-Cyber-Defence/PrimAITE/fork).
* Install the pre-commit hook with `pre-commit install`.
* Implement the bug fix.
* Commit the bug fix to the dev branch on your fork. If the bug has an open issue under [Issues](https://github.com/Autonomous-Resilient-Cyber-Defence/PrimAITE/issues), reference the issue in the commit message (e.g. #1 references issue 1).
* Submit a pull request from your dev branch to the Autonomous-Resilient-Cyber-Defence/PrimAITE dev branch. Again, if the bug has an open issue under [Issues](https://github.com/Autonomous-Resilient-Cyber-Defence/PrimAITE/issues), reference the issue in the pull request description.

### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of PrimAITE will generally not be accepted.

### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Submit a [feature request issue](https://github.com/Autonomous-Resilient-Cyber-Defence/PrimAITE/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature_request&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BREQUEST%5D+-+%3Crequest+title+goes+here%3E).
* Know how to implement the new feature or change? Follow the same steps in the bug fix section above to fork, build, document, test, commit, and submit a pull request.

### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

### **Do you want to contribute to the PrimAITE documentation?**

Please follow the "Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?" section above and tag your feature request issue and pull request with the documentation tag.
