# Plan for creating integration tests for the actions:
# I need to test that the requests coming out of the actions have the intended effect on the simulation.
# I can do this by creating a simulation, and then running the action on the simulation, and then checking
# the state of the simulation.

# Steps for creating the integration tests:
# 1. Create a fixture which creates a simulation.
# 2. Create a fixture which creates a game, including a simple agent with some actions.
# 3. Get the agent to perform an action of my choosing.
# 4. Check that the simulation has changed in the way that I expect.
# 5. Repeat for all actions.
